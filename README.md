# CSS Overdose

 -> This project is a playground for advanced and wildly experimental CSS techniques.

 ---> It was created to push CSS beyond normal limits — animations, effects, visual chaos, and things that probably shouldn’t exist… but do.

## This is not a serious UI project.
 - This is what happens when CSS drinks too much energy drink.

### Languages used: 
- HTML 
- CSS (not with Tailwind)
